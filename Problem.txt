Dream11 hosts various fantasy matches based on real life sport event. Every time when there is a cricket match between two teams, Dream11 faces challenge of creating teams of equal strength (which is just the summation of strength in individual player of each team).

For Every cricket match played between 2 teams, there are total N players from both team. 

Array a,b,c represents batsman,bowlers,wicket keepers  respectively among N players 

Array S represents strength of each Player among N players

Dream11's Objective is create TWO teams that are STRONGEST (having maximum total strength) with minimum difference in their Strength with following conditions:



x - maximum no of batsman in any team.

y - maximum no of bowlers in any team.

z - maximum no of wicket keepers in any team.



N - No of Players 

m - No of batsman in N

a - array representing batsman among N.

o - No of Bowlers in N 

b - array representing bowlers among N.

p - No of wicket keepers 

c - array representing wicket keepers among N.

x,y,z

k - no of Players each team must have .

S- Strength of each players 


Input Example 

N- 10

players Array PL- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] -- players

m- 3

a- [1,2,3]   -- where 1,2,3 are batsman from players Array

o- 3

b- [4,5,6]  -- where 4,5,6 are bowlers from players Array

p- 4

c- [7,8,9,10]     -- where 7,8,9,10 are wicket keepers from players Array

x- 1

y- 1

z-1

k- 3



S- [1,1,3,1,1,3,2,2,3,4]     -- Strength of each players 



Strength of Batsman from Array a can be Given by S[a[i]]

Strength of Bowlers from Array b can be Given by S[b[i]]

Strength of Wicket Keepers from Array c can be Given by S[c[i]]

Strength of Each Players can be Given by S[PL[i]]


Output: 

T1,T2,S1,S2,D

T1 - array of players in team1 

T2 - array of players in team2 

S1 - total strength of team1

S2 - total strength of team2

D = |S1-S2| Where D should be minimum







Two possible Team Compositions



Case 1



T1  -  [ 1, 3, 3 ]  — Total Strength  S1 = 7  

T2 -  [ 3, 1, 4 ]  — Total Strength   S2 = 8 



Diff  D = | 7 - 8 | = 1 





Case 2



T1 - [1, 3, 3 ] — Total Strength  S1= 7 

T2 - [1, 1, 4 ] —  Total Strength S2 =6 



Diff   D= | 7 - 6 | =1







Output - 



Team Composition presented in Case 1 -Should be answer ,As even if the difference between total strength of both team composition is same .The Total Strength of individual team in case 1 is higher than case 2.
